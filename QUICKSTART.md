## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused":**
- Make sure the server is running first
- Check if the port is correct

**"Port already in use":**
- Use a different port: `--port 3001`
- Or stop the existing process

**TypeScript errors:**
- Run `npm run build` to compile
- Use built version: `node dist/cli.js start`
